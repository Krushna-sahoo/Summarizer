# K-means Summarizer
This repo shows the implementation of the summarization technique by applying K-Meeans clustering over vector embeddings of given text. Blog link - https://medium.com/@akankshagupta371/understanding-text-summarization-using-k-means-clustering-6487d5d37255
Here I have also implemented a way to find the optimal number of clusters using Silhouette score and gap statistics
